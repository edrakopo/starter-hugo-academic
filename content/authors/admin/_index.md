Dr. Evangelia Drakopoulou is a senior researcher in **experimental astroparticle physics**, specializing in neutrino experiments and the development of advanced **machine learning and deep learning** techniques. She joined the Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics at NCSR "Demokritos" in 2021. Dr. Drakopoulou earned her B.Sc. (2009) and M.Sc. (2011) in Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences from the National Technical University of Athens and her Ph.D. in Elementary Particle Physics, focusing on “Muon and Neutrino Energy Reconstruction for KM3NeT,” in 2016.
From 2016 to 2021, she was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Edinburgh, participating in international neutrino collaborations including Hyper-Kamiokande, TITUS/E61 (Japan) and ANNIE (Fermilab, USA). She is currently working on KM3NeT (EU), ANNIE (USA) and Hyper-Kamiokande (Japan) neutrino experiments.
Her research bridges **astroparticle physics** and **artificial intelligence**, developing algorithms for *rare-event detection*, *particle property prediction* and *data-driven analysis* across scientific domains.
