Dr. Evangelia Drakopoulou is a senior researcher in **experimental astroparticle
physics**, specializing in neutrino experiments and the development of advanced
**machine learning and deep learning** techniques.

Dr. Drakopoulou joined the Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics at NCSR
"Demokritos" in 2021. She earned her B.Sc. (2009) and M.Sc. (2011) in Applied
Mathematical and Physical Sciences from the National Technical University of
Athens and her Ph.D. in Elementary Particle Physics, focusing on “Muon and
Neutrino Energy Reconstruction for KM3NeT,” in 2016.

From 2016 to 2021, she was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University
of  Edinburgh, participating in international neutrino collaborations
including  Hyper-Kamiokande, TITUS/E61 (Japan) and ANNIE (Fermilab, USA). 

She is currently working on KM3NeT (EU), ANNIE (USA) and Hyper-Kamiokande
(Japan) neutrino experiments. Her research bridges **astroparticle physics** and
**artificial intelligence**, developing algorithms for *rare-event detection*,
*particle property prediction* and *data-driven analysis* across scientific
domains.
